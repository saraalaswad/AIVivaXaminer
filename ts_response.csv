Response,Student's Message
"Hi <STUDENT>, hope I didn't get you up too early!","Don't worry, my exam is on next Saturday, so I should get up early."
"Ah OK, so good practice then...is that an IELTS exam?",Exactly.
I've lost track of how many you've done,I hope I can do as usual at the real exam.haha
Do you mean get a score you get in practice tests?,"Yes, I could get 37 of reading yesterday!!"
Wow that's really good - well done...you've definitely made a lot of progress. And what's your normal score on listening these days?,"Around 30, listening is harder for me."
OK that's quite common to be better at reading - but 30 is still more than respectable. I guess maybe speaking is the toughest part?,"Yeah, because it's difficult to practice..."
Yeah sure - I guess what we're doing right now is a weird mixture of speaking and writing....because you're kind of under pressure to reply straight away like in speaking you know?,You're right. I'm trying to reply as soon as possible.
Yes well don't worry too much - are you doing this one on your phone like you said you might? IS it quicker/easier?,"Yeah, I'm using my phone, it's better than the last time, isn't it??"
I'd say you're definitely faster yeah - this is me at maximum speed I'm afraid!,It's good for me. haha
:) Listen <STUDENT> I thought I'd try something a bit more specific if that's OK - so here goes...,
Whatâ€™s the connection?  Tokyo/Japan,Do you mean my hometown?
No I mean: what's the connection between those two words?,"Ah, it's a capital city"
OK yes! Tell me a sentence can you please?,
I mean with that exact example.,Tokyo is a capital city in Japan.
OK thanks - is there another capital city in Japan?,"No, there is only one."
Ah ok so...Tokyo....?,Tokyo is the capital!!
You got it! OK another one: What's the connection: Pacific/Everest,Mt.Everest is the highest in the Pacific...?
OK just tell me about the second one...Mt Everest is....?,the highest mountain in the Pacific??
Sorry <STUDENT>! I mean write this in a  full sentence: Mt Everest/highest/world,Mt Everest is the highest in the Pacific world.
,"I'm not sure, sorry."
That's OK my fault! OK this is what I was thinking of: Mt Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Can you now do a sentence with the ocean (forget about connecting it to Mt Everest!) THanks,Pacific is the widest ocean in the world!!
OK thanks great! And one more with this keyword: Sahara,Sahara is the largest desert in the world.
OK thanks <STUDENT>. I wanted to check this area (or part of it at first) for articles! Does that you make you change any of your answers?,"Sure, it's okay."
I'll give you a clue: if you are talking about oceans/deserts/rivers you need....?,
the the the the the the the the but only once obviously,I need to put 'the'??
Yes!,
"So, do one again with Sahara can you?",The sahara is the largest desert in the world!!
"Perfect! OK <STUDENT>,can you choose one desert, one river and one ocean and tell me anything you like about each one? THanks",
Start with just river if you like,The Thames is the most famous river in the UK.
Thanks great example ..and nice that you know you can just say The Thames if you like and not always the river Thames,
OK do a ocean/sea or desert OK?,I don't know about desert well...so I'm talking about a ocean.
OK fine (Sorry by the way it should the River Thames as in River with a capital r !),The Atlantic is known that there is an ocean between Europe and America.
OK thanks <STUDENT> - correct 'the Atlantic' perfect (I didn't understand the bit about 'is known that ' though I'm afraid!,"Sorry, it was an unnecessary part!!"
Ok no problem! Listen <STUDENT> can you tell me about any famous places (like buildings) you have visited in the UK - just one sentnce is enough,Brighton is one of the best resort place in Europe.
OK thanks - yes I remember you said you went there. It's pretty cool right? What did you like about it?,
And what did you do/where did you go hen you were there?,"I went to also Bournemouth, but Brighton is more attractive for me. Due to the landscape."
,"I ate some seafood, it was good."
OK right - I guess you've noticed that seafood is not the most common food for English people to eat! Can you give me an example of a specific place (like a building) you have visited in Cambridge.,
I mean a well-known place,
Not like your bathroom or something!,"Sure. It's Kings college, the garden was really beautiful."
OK yes nice example - a really famous one.What about any museums?,"I like the Fitzwilliam museum, I'm not sure about the spelling"
No that's correct <STUDENT>! So you said your two examples correctly: The Fitzwilliam and King's College (without 'the') - do you know the (semi) rule?!,I think facilities like museum need to be put 'the'...
Yes good point! So hotels/theatres/cinemas/museums/galleries etc have 'the' - can you give me another  example of one of these you've been to?,The light cinema is near to my house.
Ah you live quite centrally - I'm jealous! (sort of) And e.g. King's College/Barclay's (bank)/St Mary's Church do NOT have 'the' - can you see what they have in common?!,"It's owned by someone like King, St Mary and Barclay??"
Yeah that's it basically! so the 'someone' is the important bit - a name! Can you give me another example of a place like this?,I have no idea except Queen's college...
No that's fine! Correct example! One final test: where does Donald trump work? The building I mean...,
It's got the name of a colour in it...and it's not black!,White house.haha
yes good! But is the colour named after a person or is it just a colour?,
do you think?,
it's just a colour so...it's called...?,"Hmmm, the White house!!"
Yay!,
OK thank's <STUDENT> -we'll leave it there ok? Good to talk to you again.,"Okay, thank you!!"
I'll be in touch - feel free to send me an email yourself!,"Sure, see you."
OK bye...,
